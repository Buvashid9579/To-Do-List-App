**Professional To-Do List Application**

This is a modern, interactive to-do list application built with core web technologies. It's designed to be more than just a simple task tracker, offering a rich user experience with advanced features for managing your daily tasks effectively.

**Key Features**

1. Drag & Drop Reordering: Easily prioritize your tasks by dragging and dropping them into your desired order.

2. In-Place Editing: Double-click on any task to edit its content directly without needing to open a new modal or form.

3. Task Deletion & Restoration: A dedicated delete button removes tasks, and a temporary pop-up allows you to restore a deleted item immediately.

4. Task Details: Add a due date, priority level, and category for each task directly from the main interface.

5. Filtering & Search: Find exactly what you need with a powerful search bar and filter buttons to view all, pending, or completed tasks.

6. Progress Bar: A visual progress bar at the bottom of the page shows your completion percentage, providing a clear overview of your progress.

7. Dynamic Sorting: Sort your tasks by priority or due date to quickly see what's most important.

2. CSS3: For all styling, layout, and animations.
